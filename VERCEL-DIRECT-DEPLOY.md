# üöÄ DEPLOY LANDING PAGE TO VERCEL (DIRECT METHOD)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è GitHub is blocking pushes due to old API keys in history

Since we can't push to GitHub right now, let's deploy directly via Vercel CLI!

---

## ‚úÖ **OPTION 1: MANUAL DEPLOYMENT VIA VERCEL CLI**

### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI (if not installed)
```powershell
npm install -g vercel
```

### Step 2: Login to Vercel
```powershell
vercel login
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Production
```powershell
vercel --prod
```

This will deploy your current local code (including the landing page) directly to Vercel!

---

## ‚úÖ **OPTION 2: TEST LOCALLY FIRST**

Your landing page works locally! Test it now:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Then open: **http://localhost:5173/landing**

---

## üé® **WHAT'S IN THE LANDING PAGE:**

- ‚ú® Animated gradient background
- ‚ú® 20 floating music note particles
- ‚ú® Interactive cursor glow effect
- ‚ú® Smooth entrance animations
- ‚ú® Two stunning CTA buttons
- ‚ú® Feature cards with icons
- ‚ú® Fully responsive design
- ‚ú® Modern glassmorphism effects

## üìù **ALTERNATIVE: FIX GITHUB HISTORY**

To fix the GitHub secret scanning issue permanently:

```powershell
# Create a fresh branch without history
git checkout --orphan fresh-main
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Add landing page and clean history"
git branch -D main
git branch -m main
git push origin main --force
```

**WARNING**: This rewrites history. Make sure you have backups!

---

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP:**

**Use Vercel CLI to deploy directly:**

```powershell
vercel --prod
```

This bypasses GitHub entirely and deploys your landing page immediately!
